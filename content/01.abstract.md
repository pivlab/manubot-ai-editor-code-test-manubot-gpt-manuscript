## Abstract {.page_break_before}

This study explores the integration of advanced natural language processing models to streamline the laborious task of writing and revising scholarly manuscripts.
We propose incorporating large language models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem to suggest revisions for scholarly texts.
Our AI-based revision workflow utilizes a prompt generator that integrates manuscript metadata into templates, generating section-specific instructions for the language model.
The model then produces revised versions of each paragraph for human authors to review.
We conducted three case studies on existing manuscripts, including the revision of this manuscript, to evaluate this methodology.
Our findings suggest that these models, despite some limitations, can comprehend complex academic concepts and improve text quality.
All modifications to the manuscript are tracked using a version control system, ensuring transparency in distinguishing between human- and machine-generated text.
By integrating large language models into the scholarly writing process, researchers can significantly enhance the quality of their work, allowing them to focus on the novelty of their ideas while automating mundane tasks like adhering to specific writing styles.
While the use of AI-assisted tools in scientific authoring may be contentious, our approach, which concentrates on revising human-written text and provides change-tracking transparency, can address concerns regarding AI's role in scientific writing.
