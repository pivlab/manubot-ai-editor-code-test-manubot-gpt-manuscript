## Abstract {.page_break_before}

In this study, we explore how advanced natural language processing models can alleviate the burdensome task of drafting and editing academic papers.
Specifically, we incorporate large language models within the Manubot publishing framework to offer revision suggestions for academic texts.
This AI-driven revision process utilizes a prompt generator that leverages manuscript metadata to create section-specific guidance for the language model, which in turn produces revised drafts for authors to evaluate.
We assessed this approach by conducting case studies on three existing manuscripts, including the revision of this very paper.
Our findings reveal that, despite certain limitations, these models are capable of understanding complex academic concepts and improving the quality of the text.
Moreover, we employ a version control system to meticulously track all modifications, ensuring clear differentiation between contributions made by humans and those generated by the machine.
This integration of large language models into the academic writing process promises to significantly enhance the efficiency of scholarly work, allowing researchers to focus more on the innovative aspects of their research while automating mundane writing tasks.
Although the deployment of AI-assisted tools in academic writing is subject to debate, our method—centered on refining texts authored by humans and providing a transparent record of changes—aims to address concerns about the role of AI in scientific communication.
