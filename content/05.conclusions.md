## Conclusions

Our tool, the Manubot AI Editor, combines AI-based editing tools with the Manubot publishing platform.
Writing academic papers can be difficult and time-consuming, so our goal was to use technology to help researchers communicate their findings more clearly.
Our AI editing process involves a prompt generator that gives specific instructions for each section of a manuscript to the language model.
Authors can easily initiate this process from the GitHub repository to suggest edits that can be reviewed later.
This process utilizes GPT-3 models through the OpenAI API, which creates a list of edits for authors to review.
We have set default parameters for GPT-3 models that work well for different sections and manuscripts.
Users also have the option to customize the editing process by selecting specific sections, adjusting the model's behavior, or providing custom prompts.
This customization can be helpful for simpler editing tasks.
While evaluating the effectiveness of automatic text editing is challenging, we found that most paragraphs were improved, although in some cases, important information was removed or errors were introduced.
The AI model also identified paragraphs that were difficult to revise, which could also be challenging for human readers.


We created specific prompts for different sections to help revise text using GPT-3.
Interestingly, the model caught an error in a Methods section that humans had missed when referencing a symbol in an equation.
However, the model had difficulty revising abstracts, often removing important background information about the research problem.
There are opportunities to enhance AI-based revisions by refining prompts through few-shot learning or fine-tuning the model with more academic writing data focused on challenging sections.
Fine-tuning with preprint-publication pairs could help identify sections likely to change during peer review.
Our method involved processing each paragraph with GPT-3, but lacked continuity between queries, particularly affecting the Results and Methods sections.
Using chatbots that maintain context could improve paragraph revisions by considering previously processed text.
We intend to update our workflow to incorporate this approach.
Open and semi-open models like BLOOM, Meta's Llama 2, and Mistral 7B are gaining popularity and capabilities, although they do not offer the user-friendly OpenAI API.
We assessed the outcomes of AI-based revisions using a combination of human evaluation and available automated tools at the time.
New frameworks such as OpenAI Evals or strategies like LLM-as-a-Judge could automate the evaluation of revision quality.
Despite some limitations, we found that models captured the main ideas and produced revisions that often conveyed the intended meaning more clearly and concisely.
While our study utilized OpenAI's GPT-3, the Manubot AI Editor now supports GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models, which were released after our research was completed.


The use of AI tools for scientific writing has sparked debate.
Concerns have been raised about the originality and ownership of texts produced by these models.
For instance, *Nature* journal requires documentation for any use of AI in scientific writing, while the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) has banned papers containing text from large language models (LLMs), except for grammar and spelling corrections.
Our research focuses on revising text already written by humans.
All changes, whether made by humans or AI, are tracked for transparency.
Despite these concerns, there are promising opportunities.
Our work sets the groundwork for a future where humans and machines collaborate on academic papers.
Writing scientific articles can be time-consuming and require significant effort to convey results effectively.
As machines improve text quality, humans can concentrate on the content rather than the writing process.
This could lead to a more efficient and fair research environment, where scientists can focus on their ideas and experiments to explore the principles of ourselves and our surroundings.
