## Evaluations of AI-based revisions {#sec:results}

### Evaluation setup

<!-- In addition, there could be multiple different yet valid revisions with a varying degree of quality. -->
Evaluating the performance of text generation tasks, particularly in the context of automatic revisions of scientific content, presents challenges.
It is crucial to ensure that revisions do not alter the original meaning or introduce incorrect information.
To address this concern, our approach prioritizes human assessments of the revisions to mitigate potential issues.
We applied the same methodology to evaluate our tool, using three manuscripts authored by our team.
This approach allowed for a more objective assessment of changes in meaning and the retention of important details.
Additionally, during the prompt engineering phase, we utilized a unit testing framework to verify that the revisions generated by our prompts met established quality standards.

#### Language models

We tested our AI-assisted revision workflow with three GPT-3 models from OpenAI: `text-davinci-003`, `text-davinci-edit-001`, and `text-curie-001`.
The first two are based on the advanced GPT-3 Davinci models.
`text-davinci-003` is ready for production at the completion endpoint, while `text-davinci-edit-001` is in beta for the edits endpoint, offering a more user-friendly approach for revising manuscripts with input instructions and text to revise.
The `text-curie-001` model, described as "very capable" by its creators, is a faster and more cost-effective option compared to the Davinci models.

<!-- Using these manuscripts, we tested and improved our prompts. -->
<!-- Our findings are reported below. -->

#### Evaluation using human assessments

We enabled the Manubot AI revision workflow in the GitHub repositories of the three manuscripts (CCC, PhenoPLIER, and Manubot-AI).
This added the "ai-revision" workflow to the "Actions" tab of each repository.
We triggered the workflow manually and used the three language models described above to produce one pull request (PR) per manuscript and model.
These PRs can be accessed from the "Pull requests" tab of each repository.
They are titled *"GPT (MODEL) used to revise manuscript"*, with *MODEL* being the identifier of the model used.
The PRs show all the differences between the original text and the AI-based revision suggestions.
<!-- We discuss below our findings based on these PRs across different sections of the manuscripts. -->
We evaluated our tool using three manuscripts: the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), PhenoPLIER, and Manubot-AI.
CCC is a correlation coefficient for transcriptomic data, while PhenoPLIER is a framework for genetic studies.
CCC focuses on computational biology, while PhenoPLIER is related to genomic medicine.
CCC applies one computational method to gene expression data, while PhenoPLIER integrates regression, clustering, and drug-disease prediction using data from GWAS, TWAS, gene expression, and transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations.
PhenoPLIER is more complex, with additional figures, tables, and equations in the Methods section.
Manubot-AI, the third manuscript, has a simpler structure and was written and revised using our tool before submission, showcasing an AI-based revision use case.


When manually assessing the quality of the revisions, we considered whether the revision: 1) preserve the original meaning, 2) preserve important details, 4) introduced new and incorrect information, and 5) preserve the correct Markdown format (e.g., citations, equations).


#### Prompt engineering

We conducted extensive testing of our tool, including prompts, using a unit testing framework.
The unit tests encompassed general manuscript content processing, custom prompt generation with manuscript metadata, and text suggestion implementation to preserve the original style.
Additionally, basic quality measures of the revised text were evaluated.
These tests were utilized during prompt engineering to ensure that section-specific prompts resulted in revisions meeting minimum quality standards.
For example, unit tests were created to verify that Abstracts are a single paragraph, begin with a capital letter, end with a period, and do not contain citations.
In the Introduction section, we checked that a certain percentage of citations were retained, allowing the model flexibility to eliminate unnecessary text.
We discovered that adding the instruction *"most of the citations to other academic papers are kept"* to the prompt enabled the most capable model to achieve this.
Unit tests were also developed to confirm that the models returned citations in the correct Manubot/Markdown format (e.g., `[@doi:...]` or `[@arxiv:...]`), and no prompt adjustments were necessary as the model automatically detected the correct format in most instances.
In the Results section, tests were conducted with short inline LaTeX formulas (e.g., `$\gamma_l$`) and references to figures, tables, equations, or other sections (e.g., `Figure @id` or `Equation (@id)`).
The most capable model successfully retained these elements in the correct format in the majority of cases.
For the Methods section, in addition to the aforementioned tests, we evaluated the models' ability to correctly format numbered, multiline equations and found that the most capable model succeeded in most cases.
In this specific scenario, we modified our prompt to explicitly specify the correct format for multiline equations (refer to prompt for Methods in Figure @fig:ai_revision).


We also included tests where the model is expected to fail in generating a revision (for instance, when the input paragraph is too long for the model's context length).
In these cases, we ensure that the tool returns a proper error message.
We ran our unit tests across all models under evaluation.


### General assessment of language models

Initial assessments of the three manuscripts and unit tests showed that the Curie model, while faster and more cost-effective, was unable to provide satisfactory revisions.
Analysis of the pull requests (PRs) revealed that the model's suggestions did not align with the original text in any manuscript section.
The model struggled to comprehend revision instructions, often failing to produce coherent revisions and making errors such as replacing text with instructions, adding the manuscript title at the beginning of paragraphs, omitting citations, and inserting irrelevant content.
Additionally, we observed that the quality of revisions generated by the `text-davinci-edit-001` model (edits endpoint) was lower than those from the `text-davinci-003` model (completion endpoint), possibly due to the edits endpoint being in beta during testing.
The `text-davinci-003` model consistently delivered the best results across all manuscripts and sections, prompting us to focus on this model for further evaluation.


### Revision of different sections

<!-- These are our subjective assessments of the quality of the revisions, and we encourage the reader to inspect the PRs for each manuscript and model to see the full diffs and make their own conclusions. -->
We evaluated the pull requests (PRs) created by the AI-driven workflow and analyzed the modifications proposed by the tool in various parts of the manuscripts.
The PRs are available in the GitHub repositories of the manuscripts (Table 1) and are also provided as diff files in Supplementary File 1 (CCC), 2 (PhenoPLIER), and 3 (Manubot-AI).

#### Abstract

Single words are not underlined/highlighed in this case because the revision completely overhauled the text.
](images/diffs/abstract/ccc-abstract.svg "Diffs - CCC abstract"){#fig:abstract:ccc width="75%"}

The AI-based revision workflow was applied to the CCC abstract (Figure @fig:abstract:ccc).
The tool completely rephrased the text, with only the final sentence remaining mostly unchanged.
The revised text was significantly shorter and contained longer sentences compared to the original, potentially impacting readability.
The revision eliminated the initial two sentences discussing correlation analyses and transcriptomics, and directly stated the manuscript's purpose.
Methodological details were removed, focusing on the aims and results achieved, concluding with the same last sentence suggesting broader application of the coefficient to other data domains, aligning with the original intent of the authors of CCC.
The key concepts remained intact in the revised text.


The revised text for the abstract of PhenoPLIER was significantly shortened (from 10 sentences in the original, to only 3 in the revised version).
However, in this case, important concepts (such as GWAS, TWAS, CRISPR) and a proper amount of background information were missing, producing a less informative abstract.


#### Introduction

![
**First paragraph in the Introduction section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/introduction/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC introduction paragraph 01"){#fig:intro:ccc width="75%"}

The tool significantly revised the Introduction section of CCC, as shown in Figure 1, producing a more concise and clear introductory paragraph.
The revised first sentence combined ideas from the original two sentences, introducing the concept of "large datasets" and opportunities for scientific exploration.
The model generated a more concise second sentence introducing the "need for efficient tools" to find "multiple relationships" in these datasets.
The third sentence flowed well from the previous one.
All references to scientific literature were maintained in the correct Manubot format, despite our prompts not specifying the references format.
The remaining sentences in this section were also appropriately revised and could be seamlessly integrated into the manuscript with minor or no further adjustments.


A high-quality revision of the introduction of PhenoPLIER was observed.
However, the model failed to maintain citation format in one paragraph.
Furthermore, the model did not converge to a revised text for the last paragraph, resulting in an error message: "The AI model returned an empty string." Debugging the prompts uncovered this issue, possibly due to the paragraph's complexity.
Rerunning the automated revision may resolve such issues.


#### Results

![
**A paragraph in the Results section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
Single words are not underlined/highlighed in this case because the revision completely overhauled the text.
](images/diffs/results/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC results paragraph 01"){#fig:results:ccc width="75%"}

The tool was tested on a paragraph from the Results section of CCC (Figure 1).
This paragraph describes four datasets in the CCC manuscript, each with two variables and different labeled relationships or patterns.
The model generated a good summary of how all coefficients performed in the last two nonlinear patterns, and why CCC was able to capture them.
CCC increased the model's complexity to capture the relationships.
The revised paragraph is more concise and clearly describes what the figure shows and how CCC works.
The model also produced high-quality revisions for several other paragraphs that would only need minor changes.


However, some paragraphs in CCC needed significant revisions before being included in the manuscript.
The model produced more concise, direct, and clear text for certain paragraphs.
However, this sometimes led to the omission of crucial details and changes in the original meaning of sentences.
To resolve this issue, we decided to adopt the simplified sentence structure suggested by the model, while also adding back the missing details to ensure clarity and completeness.

](images/diffs/results/phenoplier-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - PhenoPLIER results paragraph 01"){#fig:results:phenoplier width="75%"}


When the model was applied to the PhenoPLIER manuscript, it successfully revised most paragraphs in the Manubot/Markdown format, maintaining citations and references to figures, tables, and other sections.
While some important details were initially missing, they could easily be reintegrated without compromising the improved sentence structure.
However, in certain instances, the model's output highlighted the limitations of revising individual paragraphs without considering the context of the entire text.
For example, a paragraph detailing our CRISPR screening approach to evaluate potential therapeutic targets associated with top genes in a latent variable (LV) was inaccurately revised, as depicted in Figure 1.
The revised paragraph omitted crucial information regarding the CRISPR screen and gene symbols related to lipid regulation, which were essential components of the original text.
Instead, the revised text described a non-existent experiment with a reference to a non-existent section, indicating a focus on the manuscript's title and keywords, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2.
The revision included terms like "gene co-expression" analysis and "clusters of genes" in place of "sets of genes," aligning more closely with the keywords provided.
This flawed revision suggests that the original paragraph may have been too brief or disconnected from surrounding content and could benefit from being merged with the subsequent paragraph discussing follow-up and related experiments.


#### Discussion

In both the CCC and PhenoPLIER manuscripts, revisions to the discussion section appeared to be of high quality.
The model kept the correct format when necessary (e.g., using italics for gene symbols), maintained most of the citations, and improved the readability of the text in general.
Revisions for some paragraphs introduced minor mistakes that a human author could readily fix.

**A paragraph in the Discussion section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/discussion/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC discussion paragraph 01"){#fig:discussion:ccc width="75%"}

One paragraph from the Results section highlights the potential impact of not-only-linear correlation coefficients on genetic studies of complex traits (see Figure 1).
The revised text presents minor changes that improve readability.
The model demonstrated an understanding of citation formatting by correctly merging and separating two referenced articles into a single citation block using a ";" in line 2.


#### Methods

Prompts for the Methods section were the most challenging to design, especially when the sections included equations.
The prompt for Methods (Figure @fig:ai_revision) is more focused in keeping the technical details, which was especially important for PhenoPLIER, whose Methods section contains paragraphs with several mathematical expressions.

**A paragraph in the Methods section of PhenoPLIER.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/methods/phenoplier-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - PhenoPLIER methods paragraph 01"){#fig:methods:phenoplier width="75%"}

We revised a paragraph in PhenoPLIER that contained two numbered equations (Figure @fig:methods:phenoplier).
The model made minimal changes, preserving most of the original text, equations, and citations.
However, we noted that the model corrected a reference to a mathematical symbol (line 8) that was incorrect in the original version (line 7).
Specifically, the equation in the original paragraph (lines 4-6) used the *true* effect size $\gamma_l$ (`\gamma_l`) instead of the *estimated* effect size $\hat{\gamma}_l$ (`\hat{\gamma}_l`) in the univariate model employed by PrediXcan.


In PhenoPLIER, we found one large paragraph with several equations that the model failed to revise, although it performed relatively well in revising the rest of the section.
In CCC, the revision of this section was good overall, with some minor and easy-to-fix issues as in the other sections.


Issues arose from revising paragraphs individually without context.
In PhenoPLIER, linear models used by S-PrediXcan and S-MultiXcan were mentioned without providing equations or details.
The model added these equations immediately in the correct Manubot/Markdown format, as it had not yet encountered that information in the following paragraphs.


![
**A paragraph in the Methods section of ManubotAI.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
The revision (right) contains a repeated set of sentences at the top that we removed to improve the clarity of the figure.
](images/diffs/methods/manubotai-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - ManubotAI methods paragraph 01"){#fig:methods:manubotai width="75%"}


During the revision of the Methods section in this manuscript, the Manubot-AI model occasionally generated new sentences with incorrect information.
For instance, it included a formula to predict the cost of a revision run in one paragraph.
In another paragraph (see Figure 1), it mentioned that the model was trained on a corpus of scientific papers from the same field and that its suggested revisions produced a modified version of the manuscript ready for submission.
While these are valuable future directions, they do not accurately reflect the current work.
