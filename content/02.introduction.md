## Introduction

The practice of scholarly writing has a rich history, stretching back thousands of years.
It underwent a significant transformation with the creation of scientific journals around 350 years ago (Smith, 1976).
The concept of external peer review, now a cornerstone of many academic journals, was introduced less than a century ago (Burnham, 1990).
Typically, manuscripts are crafted by individuals or collaborative teams aiming to present new discoveries, review existing knowledge, or advocate for changes in established practices.
Yet, the process of scholarly writing can be notably time-consuming, requiring the presentation of study results in a precise style and format.
Moreover, academic authors often take a circuitous path to their main points, making their texts challenging for readers to navigate (Ledford, 2018).

Recent improvements in computer technology and the easy access to vast amounts of text, images, and other data online have set the stage for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are incredibly complex.
One type of these systems, known as large language models (LLMs), is particularly groundbreaking.
These models are capable of changing the way we live and work by introducing new technologies.
For example, OpenAI has developed models that can create text that sounds like it was written by a human.
These models use a special method called the transformer architecture, which helps them understand and produce language.
The most famous examples are the Generative Pre-trained Transformer models, known as GPT-3 and the more recent GPT-4.
These models are very good at a variety of tasks, including writing text, completing programming code, and answering questions.

In the field of medical information, researchers are starting to see how these AI tools can help make clinical decisions more efficient or even address health inequalities.
However, there are also worries about how they might affect medical education and the importance of keeping human judgment at the core of AI development and use.
These AI tools are also enhancing how scientific findings are shared and communicated.
They offer a promising way to help scientists write and edit research papers more efficiently, allowing them to spend more time on critical tasks like analyzing data and drawing conclusions.
Nevertheless, the use of LLMs in research has been controversial.
One of the main concerns is that they can produce content that seems accurate but is actually false or misleading.

In this study, we introduce a method that places humans at the center of using artificial intelligence (AI) to write academic papers.
This method starts with a text written by humans, then uses AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to suggest edits.
Finally, humans review and approve these suggestions.
This process reduces the risk of creating inaccurate information while still taking advantage of the benefits that AI offers in writing assistance.
We have developed a tool that assists with revising documents using this method, which is built upon the Manubot platform.
Manubot is designed for both individual authors and large groups working together on scholarly publishing projects, as detailed in prior studies (Himmelstein et al., 2019; Perkel, 2021).

Our tool, which we call the Manubot AI Editor, analyzes the manuscript and uses an LLM to suggest specific revisions for different sections.
It then proposes these revisions for the author to consider, displaying them through the GitHub interface.
To ensure the AI's suggestions meet a basic quality standard, we created tests that the revisions must pass.
We tested the effectiveness of these AI-generated suggestions by manually reviewing them in three different manuscripts that were written using Manubot and covered various complex topics.
Our tests showed that the AI often preserved the original meaning of the text, enhanced the writing style, and could even handle mathematical expressions.

Now an official part of the Manubot platform, the Manubot AI Editor is available for use in Manubot-based writing projects.
We believe it will aid authors in communicating their research more efficiently and effectively.
